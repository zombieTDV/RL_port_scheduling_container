# DYNAMIC_ROBOTIC_ARM_DESIGN_DECISIONS.md — Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Dynamic Arm & Gripper Architecture

- **Motivation/Background**: The initial simulation implementation relied on pre-baked geometric elevation angles triggered by hardcoded keyboard keys [1, 2, 3, 4]. Advancing the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator (MoMa) to true dynamic industrial realism requires continuous 3D Inverse Kinematics (IK), mechanical two-finger clamping, dynamic trajectory insertion, and robust physics collision resolution.
- **Purpose**: Serve as the living architectural design decision record (DDR) and trade-off reference matrix for the dynamic robotic arm and pickup system, documenting all design branches, options considered, and selected pathways so future contributors can revisit or toggle approaches.
- **Overview Pipeline**: Formulated during the comprehensive `/grill-me` architectural design review between developer and AI pair programmer.
- **Detailed Plan**: §1 Master Decision Matrix; §2 Branch 1: Gripper & Clamping Mechanism; §3 Branch 2: Kinematic Model & 3D Target IK; §4 Branch 3: Approach Trajectory & Clearance; §5 Branch 4: Target Selection & Interaction; §6 Branch 5: Cargo Tray Retention; §7 Branch 6: Reach Guardrails; §8 Branch 7: Dynamic Pick & Place Flow.

## 2. Branch 1: Gripper & Pickup Mechanism

### The Problem
In 3D physics engines running at $\Delta t = \frac{1}{60}\,\text{s}$, when an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) accelerates at $9.0\,\text{m/s}^2$ and turns at $3.2\,\text{rad/s}$, pure discrete friction clamping against a $12\,\text{kg}$ rigid body is vulnerable to micro-slippage or solver penetration repulsion ("pinch explosions").

### Options Evaluated

1. **Option A: Pure Vacuum / Socket Lock (Kinematic)**:
   - *How it works*: Proximity trigger reparents the box to the wrist with fixed transform.
   - *Pros*: Extremely stable, 0% physics jitter, minimal CPU cost.
   - *Cons*: Lacks visible mechanical moving fingers; looks like magic suction rather than a mechanical manipulator.

2. **Option B: Pure Physics Joint Constraint (`Generic6DOFJoint3D`)**:
   - *How it works*: Creates a 6-DOF dynamic joint connecting gripper and tote.
   - *Pros*: Full rigid-body momentum coupling.
   - *Cons*: Can wobble, sag, or vibrate under heavy arm acceleration and high chassis speeds.

3. **Option C (Selected): Hybrid Two-Finger Mechanical Clamping Gripper**:
   - *How it works*:
     - **Visual**: Two articulated fingers (`FingerLeft`, `FingerRight`) mechanically slide or pivot inward to flank the box.
     - **Collision**: High-friction finger pads touch the outer walls of the box.
     - **Grip Assist**: When both pads detect firm bilateral contact, an internal constraint locks the box relative to the gripper carriage during high-speed transit.
     - **Release**: Releasing the box detaches the constraint and restores free rigid-body physics.
   - *Pros*: Visually and mechanically authentic industrial gripper behavior with guaranteed payload stability.

## 3. Branch 2: Dynamic Joint Kinematics & Target Solving

### Kinematic Model (4-DOF Articulated Planar + Yaw Arm on Pedestal Mast)
- **Joint 0 (`BaseYaw`)**: Azimuth rotation about global $Y$-axis ($\theta_0 = \text{atan2}(-x_{target}, -z_{target})$ in Godot 3D space). Mounted on a cylindrical pedestal mast raising base elevation to $Y = 0.38\,\text{m}$.
- **Joint 1 (`ShoulderPitch`)**: Primary elevation boom ($L_1 = 1.02\,\text{m}$, pivot offset $Y = 0.18\,\text{m}$ relative to turret base, total shoulder elevation $Y = 0.56\,\text{m}$ world).
- **Joint 2 (`ElbowPitch`)**: Forearm reach link ($L_2 = 0.86\,\text{m}$).
- **Joint 3 (`WristPitch`)**: End-effector leveling & pitch orientation ($L_3 = 0.25\,\text{m}$).
- **Kinematic Reach Envelope**: $R_{min} = 0.20\,\text{m}$, $R_{max} = 2.15\,\text{m}$. Enables comfortable access from Tier 1 ($h = 0.56\,\text{m}$) all the way up to Tier 4 ($h = 2.23\,\text{m}$) and floor level ($h = 0.16\,\text{m}$) from typical aisle stand-off distances ($0.6\,\text{m} - 1.0\,\text{m}$).
- **Compact Rest Pose**: Inactive arm folds down along the chassis deck ($Y_{\max} \approx 1.03\,\text{m}$, shoulder $-68^\circ$, elbow $140^\circ$, wrist $-72^\circ$, closed fingers) instead of sticking up into the sky ($2.18\,\text{m}$). Incorporates organic $0.24\,\text{Hz}$ hydraulic breathing oscillation and vehicle acceleration suspension compliance.

### Selected Approach: Analytical Closed-Form Two-Bone IK with Ground-Parallel Wrist
- Resolves target in planar arm coordinate frame $(r, y)$ where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}$.
- Target distance is measured **strictly from the shoulder joint** (`shoulder.global_position.distance_to(target.global_position)`), ensuring intuitive operator range readings that accurately reflect arm capabilities.
- Uses law of cosines for deterministic, closed-form computation (zero iteration latency, perfectly repeatable, no numerical drift).
- Automatically maintains gripper horizontal or oriented to the box grasping plane.

## 4. Branch 3: Approach Trajectory & Shelf Clearance

### The Problem
Reaching directly toward a box in a single diagonal path risks colliding with lower/upper shelf divider plates ($h = 0.90, 1.46, 2.02\,\text{m}$) or vertical corner posts ($x = \pm 0.75\,\text{m}$).

### Selected Approach: 3-Stage Waypoint Trajectory with Adaptive Pullback
1. **Stage 1 (Pre-Grasp Staging)**: Arm moves to an adaptive staging point outside the shelf bay. Pullback distance is dynamically scaled (`clampf(local_dist - 0.32, 0.10, 0.25)`) to preserve kinematic clearance without violating $R_{min}$. Graceful elevation fallback ensures 100% reachable targets are picked.
2. **Stage 2 (Linear Insertion)**: Arm translates strictly horizontally along the bay axis into the shelf space until the open gripper fingers embrace the box.
3. **Stage 3 (Linear Retraction)**: Once fingers clamp the box, the arm pulls straight back out into the aisle clear zone before initiating any base yaw rotation or tray stowing.

## 5. Branch 4: Target Selection & Interaction

### Selected Approach: Interactive 3D Click & Proximity Hybrid with ESC Cancel
- **Method 1 (Mouse Raycast)**: The operator clicks on any `ToteBox` in the 3D viewport (whether on a rack tier or resting on the floor). A holographic targeting reticle highlights the selected box.
- **Method 2 (Proximity Auto-Target)**: If no box is clicked, pressing `[E]` casts a forward-facing sensor cone ($\pm 60^\circ, R \le 2.15\,\text{m}$) from the AMR shoulder, automatically selecting the closest valid box.
- **Method 3 (Quick Cancel via `[ESC]`)**: Pressing `[ESC]` immediately deselects active target, hides the reticle, and smoothly tweens the manipulator back to its compact rest pose.

## 6. Branch 5: Cargo Tray Retention & Physical Sensors

### Selected Approach: Multi-Slot Tray with Dynamic Compliance & Physical Area3D Sensors
- **Payload Capacity**: 2 independent payload slots (Slot 1: Front $Z = -0.22$, Slot 2: Rear $Z = +0.22$).
- **Physical Sensor Detection (`Area3D`)**: Real-time payload presence is verified by discrete `Slot1Sensor` and `Slot2Sensor` collision areas ($0.50 \times 0.28 \times 0.32\,\text{m}$) checking for overlapping `ToteBox` instances. If a box spills or falls out, the tray counter immediately reflects reality (0/2 or 1/2) rather than tracking keypresses.
- **Dynamic Micro-Compliance & Inertia**: Stowed totes are parented to `CargoTray` with physical compliance: under acceleration and braking, boxes slide $\pm 1.8\,\text{cm}$ and pitch $\pm 2^\circ$ within tray retention rails; under turning, boxes roll $\pm 1.4^\circ$; during driving, boxes subtly vibrate with travel. Eliminates both the unnatural frozen-solid look and mid-air floating bugs.
- **Natural Crash Momentum Transfer**: In high-speed collisions ($v > 1.9\,\text{m/s}$), stowed cargo is unparented to the world root with vehicle forward momentum ($\vec{v}_{\text{box}} \approx \vec{v}_{\text{amr}} \times 0.85 + (0, 0.35, 0)$), tumbling naturally forward over the bumper onto the floor under real gravity. Avoids unrealistic rocket-booster impulses.

## 7. Branch 6: Reach Limit Guardrails

### Selected Approach: Shoulder-Relative Reach Envelope Enforcement
- **Maximum Reach Sphere**: $R_{max} = 2.15\,\text{m}$ measured directly from the shoulder pivot axis.
- **Guardrail Rule**: If shoulder target distance $d > 2.15\,\text{m}$, the system refuses execution, renders the target reticle in red, plays `SoundManager.sfx_cancel`, and displays HUD telemetry: `"⚠️ Out of Reach (%.1fm > 2.15m) | [Esc] Cancel"`.
