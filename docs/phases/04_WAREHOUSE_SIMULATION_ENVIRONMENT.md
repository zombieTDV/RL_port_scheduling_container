# 04_WAREHOUSE_SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT.md — Smart Warehouse Mobile Manipulator Simulation Specification

- **Motivation/Background**: Moving beyond illustrative frontend animations ("vibe code") requires a physically grounded, mathematically deterministic warehouse simulation engine. Modern automated fulfillment centers deploy Autonomous Mobile Manipulators (AMRs with robotic picking hands) that retrieve individual SKU tote boxes from 4-tier racking and transport multi-tote batches to pick stations.
- **Purpose**: Specify the complete architectural blueprint, spatial topology, mobile manipulator kinematics, time-space reservation anti-deadlock mechanics, discrete inventory system, and Godot 3D visualization contracts.
- **Overview Pipeline**: Python backend (`src/warehouse/`) computes the ground truth graph physics, reservation table, inventory WMS, and kinematic stepping, while Godot 4 renders the 3D Digital Twin and 2D radar over VDA 5050.
- **Detailed Plan**: §1 Scope & Agreed Architectural Decisions; §2 Input & Output Contracts; §3 Mobile Manipulator Kinematics & Arm Picking Mechanics; §4 Time-Space Anti-Deadlock Engine; §5 Discrete Inventory & Fulfillment Lifecycle; §6 Godot 3D Synchronization & Visual Controls.

## Metadata

- **Phase ID**: `PHASE-04`
- **Phase Name**: `Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Warehouse Simulation Engine & Mechanics`
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Target Modules**: [`src/warehouse/`](../../src/warehouse), [`godot/scripts/`](../../godot/scripts), [`src/utils/warehouse_bridge.py`](../../src/utils/warehouse_bridge.py)

---

## 1. Scope & Core Architectural Decisions

Following the `/grill-me` architectural design review, the simulation mechanics are locked as follows:

1. **Decoupled Architecture**:
   - **Python Core Engine (`src/warehouse/`)**: Runs ground-truth discrete-event simulation, directed grid graph, differential-drive kinematics, time-space conflict reservations, and WMS inventory tracking. Capable of fast-stepping (>1,000 steps/s) or real-time 1x clock synchronization.
   - **Godot 4 Digital Twin (`godot/`)**: High-fidelity 3D client rendering vehicle meshes, animated robotic arms, 2D Zoned Radar, and interactive operator controls via VDA 5050 WebSocket (`ws://127.0.0.1:9090`).
2. **Small Tote Boxes as the Smallest Transport Unit**:
   - The warehouse racking is stationary (4 tiers per bay).
   - The smallest transport unit is an individual **SKU Tote Box** (colored bins: Cyan=FMCG, Green=Tech, Purple=Pharma, Orange=Bulky).
3. **Mobile Manipulator Robot (MoMa)**:
   - Differential-drive mobile base with 360° LED ring.
   - Onboard payload tray capable of carrying **2 to 4 boxes** per run (enabling multi-pick batch routing).
   - Articulated **Robotic Arm / Picking Hands**:
     - **Vertical Lift (Up/Down)**: Traverses between Tiers 1 through 4 ($h = 0.4\,\text{m}$ to $2.2\,\text{m}$).
     - **Lateral Extension (Left/Right)**: Extends into shelf bays on either side of the aisle.
     - **Gripper Hands**: Pulls the target tote out and places it into the robot's onboard tray.
4. **Time-Space Anti-Deadlock Coordination**:
   - Directed grid graph ($1.2\,\text{m}$ node spacing).
   - Time-Space Reservation Table claiming `(node, [t_enter, t_exit])` and `(edge, [t_enter, t_exit])`.
   - Deterministic priority yielding at 4-way intersections with stop-bar holding (LED turns Yellow).
5. **Discrete WMS Coordinate System**:
   - Every box slot is indexed: `(Zone, Rack, Tier [1-4], Slot [1-4])`.
   - Picked slots become `EMPTY` and are re-filled during Inbound PO receiving cycles.
6. **Ergonomics & Camera**:
   - Real-time physical scale (1x) with HUD time-scale multipliers ($1\times, 2\times, 5\times$, Pause).
   - Tactical RTS overview presets (`1`–`4`) + interactive click-to-follow 3rd-person AMR camera with automatic close-up zoom during arm picking.

### 4.3 Developer Manual Bot (`DEV-01`) Dynamic Robotic Arm & 3D IK Mechanics

For manual environment testing and physical validation, `DEV-01` features a continuous 4-DOF dynamic robotic arm on a pedestal mast with analytical 3D Inverse Kinematics, parallel mechanical clamping fingers, dual-slot physical cargo tray with `Area3D` payload sensors, and interactive targeting:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> STATIONARY: Folded Travel Pose
    STATIONARY --> TARGETING: Mouse Click on Box OR Press [E]
    TARGETING --> STATIONARY: Press [Esc] to Cancel
    TARGETING --> PRE_GRASP: In-Reach (< 2.15m) + Press [E]
    TARGETING --> TARGETING: Out-of-Reach (> 2.15m Red Reticle)
    PRE_GRASP --> INSERTING: Linear Horizontal Bay Reach
    INSERTING --> CLAMPING: Mechanical Two-Finger Clamping
    CLAMPING --> RETRACTING: Linear Retraction with Box
    RETRACTING --> HELD_READY: Held in Clear Aisle Zone
    HELD_READY --> STOWING: Press [E] (Swivels to First Empty Slot)
    STOWING --> STATIONARY: Parented to Tray Bed & Folded
    HELD_READY --> PLACING: Press [G] (Lowers onto Floor in front)
    PLACING --> STATIONARY: Released as Active RigidBody3D on Floor
```

- **Interactive Operator Controls**:
  - `Mouse Left Click`: Casts 3D raycast from viewport camera to select any `ToteBox` (on rack shelf or floor).
  - `[E] Key`: Targets nearest box (if none selected) and triggers 3-stage dynamic pick; if holding box, stows to first available cargo tray slot.
  - `[G] Key`: Dynamically places held box onto the floor in front of the robot.
  - `[Esc] Key`: Quick-cancels active targeting/pick state and smoothly returns the arm to compact resting pose.
  - `Compact Folded Rest Pose & Idle Breathing`: When inactive, the arm folds down low along the chassis deck ($Y_{\max} \approx 1.03\,\text{m}$, shoulder $-68^\circ$, elbow $140^\circ$, wrist $-72^\circ$, neatly closed fingers). Implements organic $0.24\,\text{Hz}$ hydraulic breathing sway and chassis inertial suspension compliance.
  - `Targeting Reticle`: Real-time holographic ring (Cyan when in reach $\le 2.15\,\text{m}$, Red when out of reach). Target distance is measured strictly from the shoulder joint.
  - `Extended Reach Envelope`: $L_1 = 1.02\,\text{m}, L_2 = 0.86\,\text{m}, L_3 = 0.25\,\text{m}, R_{max} = 2.15\,\text{m}$, mounted on a $0.2\,\text{m}$ pedestal mast ($Y = 0.56\,\text{m}$ world shoulder height) to reach all 4 rack tiers ($h = 0.56, 1.11, 1.67, 2.23\,\text{m}$).
  - `Dual-Slot Physical Tray with Dynamic Compliance & Sensors`: Slot 1 (Front $Z = -0.22$) and Slot 2 (Rear $Z = +0.22$) equipped with physical `Area3D` sensors. Stowed boxes exhibit realistic inertial compliance (sliding $\pm 1.8\,\text{cm}$, pitching $\pm 2^\circ$, and vibrating with road travel) rather than remaining frozen solid. On high-speed impacts ($v > 1.9\,\text{m/s}$), boxes realistically tumble forward onto the floor carrying forward momentum under gravity.

### 4.5 Physical Collision Architecture, Dynamic Boxes & Environment Reset

In the **Environment Building Sector**, all physical entities are simulated in full 3D rigid-body and kinematic collision physics:

        Racks["32 Storage Pod Racks (RigidBody3D, m=280kg)<br>Layer 2: Dynamic Racks (Can Topple & Fall!)"]

        Audio["SoundManager Acoustics<br>Impact thuds & crash cues"]
    end

    AMR -->|Gravity -9.81 m/s²| Floor
    Racks -->|Gravity -9.81 m/s² & Friction| Floor
    Totes -->|Gravity -9.81 m/s² & Bounce/Friction| Floor
    AMR -->|High Speed Ram: Overturning Torque| Racks
    Racks -->|Topple >30° / High Impact: Spill All Boxes!| Totes
    AMR -->|Drive & Plow into Scattered Boxes| Totes
    Racks -->|Crash Sound Cue| Audio
```

- **Collision Layers & Masks**:
  - **Layer 1 (`Environment_Static`)**: Ground floor ($140 \times 100\,\text{m}$) and 4 boundary perimeter walls. Supports downward gravity $\vec{g} = (0, -9.81, 0)\,\text{m/s}^2$.
  - **Layer 2 (`Racks_Dynamic`)**: 32 storage pods built as **hollow compound rigid bodies** (`RigidBody3D`, $m = 280\,\text{kg}$) with 4 corner post colliders and 4 horizontal shelf divider plates, leaving real open physical space between tiers.
  - **Layer 4 (`AMR_Fleet`)**: AMRs configured as **`CharacterBody3D` with `move_and_slide()`**. Bumper collisions transfer kinetic impulse to `RigidBody3D` colliders and trigger crash SFX.
  - **Layer 8 (`Tote_Boxes`)**: 256 live physical **`ToteBox` (`RigidBody3D`, $m = 12\,\text{kg}$)** nodes. They are **100% dynamic physics objects at all times (`freeze = false`)** resting directly on top of the physical shelf plates under real gravity. When an AMR rams a rack hard enough to tip it over, the shelf plates tilt, and the boxes slide off the shelves and crash to the floor completely through natural Godot physics!
  - **AMR Box Plowing**: When `DEV-01` drives into scattered boxes on the floor, the kinematic collision loop transfers momentum, plowing, nudging, and kicking boxes across the warehouse.

- **Full Environment Reset Standard (`R` Key & HUD Reset Button)**:
  - Triggering `_reset_entire_environment()`:
    1. **All 32 Storage Racks**: Restored to their exact initial positions and upright transforms using `PhysicsServer3D.body_set_state` and `_integrate_forces`, zeroing linear and angular velocities, clearing the toppled status, and restoring zone labels.
    2. **All 256 Tote Boxes**: Teleported back onto their assigned shelf plates with zeroed velocities, ready to rest naturally under gravity.
    3. **All AMRs (`DEV-01` & Fleet)**: Reset to initial berths with zero velocity, folded arm pose, cleared cargo tray, and restored HUD telemetry.
    4. **Manifests**: Inbound and Outbound orders reset to `PENDING`.

### 4.6 RL Observation, Action & Reward Foundations

- **Observation Space $\mathbf{o}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{24}$**:
  - 16-beam normalized LiDAR distances $d_i \in [0, 1]$.
  - Chassis forward velocity $v$ and yaw rate $\omega$.
  - Relative target vector $(\Delta x_{goal}, \Delta z_{goal}, \Delta \theta_{goal})$.
  - Onboard tote count $N_{totes} \in [0, 4]$.
  - Collision bumper contact flag $\in \{0, 1\}$.
  - Lateral acceleration $a_{lateral}$.
- **Reward Formulation**:
  $$R_t = R_{progress} + R_{pick\_stow} - P_{collision} - P_{instability} - P_{time}$$
  - $R_{progress} = c_{prog} \cdot (d_{t-1} - d_t)$ (potential-based shaping).
  - $R_{pick\_stow} = +50.0$ per successfully stowed tote box.
  - $P_{collision} = -30.0 - 10.0 \cdot \|\vec{v}_{impact}\|$ (severe penalty for hitting obstacles).
  - $P_{instability} = -2.0 \cdot \max(0, |a_{lateral}| - 2.5)^2$ (penalizes load-tipping maneuvers).
  - $P_{time} = -0.02$ per timestep (encourages efficient throughput).
